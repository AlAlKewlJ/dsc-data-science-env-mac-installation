# Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - MacOS Installation

## Introduction



## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Install Git
* Install Anaconda

Let’s start by getting Git and Anaconda installed.

Please note - the exact names and versions will change over time.

## Installing Git

If you are comfortable with the command line and have installed [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you should install Git by running the command `brew install git` in a terminal window. If you have no idea what the last sentence meant, please disregard and follow the below steps.

### Overview:

1. Download the install package from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). 
2. Double click on the downloaded dmg file to open a small Finder window
3. Double click on the .pkg file to run it
    - When you try to do that you might get a security warning pop up. If that happens: 
        - Click on the apple at the top left of the screen
        - Select “System Preferences” from the drop-down menu
        - Select “Security and Privacy”
        - Select the “General” tag
        - Click on the lock to make changes at the bottom of the window (you will need to enter your password when prompted)
        - Below the “Allow apps downloaded from” option, you should see a message stating that an app was blocked from opening (if you don’t see this message, double click on the .pkg file again and then look back at the Security & Privacy screen and it should pop up). Click the “open anyway” button.
4. Click on the “Open” button when the pop-up message asks "Are you sure you want to open it?" in order to open the installer window
5. Click "Continue" on each screen, then "Install"
    - You will need to enter your password when prompted
6. When the installation is complete, click the "Close" button

## Installing Anaconda 

The easiest way to get set up with Python and Jupyter Notebook so you can start coding is to install the Anaconda distribution. 

### Overview:

1. Download the latest version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) - use Python 3.x (ignore Python 2.7)
2. Open the pkg file once it has downloaded to open the Anaconda installer

    - Option 1: When the pkg file is finished downloading, click to the right of the name of the file at the bottom of your browser, and select "Open"
    - Option 2: Navigate to your "Downloads" folder and double click on the Anaconda pkg file to open it

3. Click "Continue" to run the package to determine if the software can be installed
4. When the Installation window opens, click "Continue"
5. Look at the Read Me, then click "Continue"
6. Accept the license by clicking "Continue", then click "Agree" in the pop-up window
7. Accept the default destination
8. Click "Install" to install the software
    - You will need to enter your password when prompted
9. Wait while Anaconda is installed on your computer
10. You can skip the option to install Microsoft VSCode by clicking "Continue"
11. Click "Close" when the installation was completed successfully
12. If you're asked whether you'd like to move the Installer to Trash, click "Move to Trash"
